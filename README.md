I'm a software engineer passionate about building scalable, efficient applications with a focus on AI integrations, performance optimization, and modern web technologies. I've developed tools that handle large-scale data (35M+ records), create AI-driven experiences, and automate workflows. Always exploring new tech and open to collaborations on innovative projects. Let's connect! 🚀

## 🛠️ Skills & Technologies
I specialize in tools and frameworks for creating robust, high-performance applications. Key areas include:

- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, React Native, TypeScript, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Highcharts, Mapbox – optimizing UIs for speed, even with data-intensive pages (e.g., reducing load times to 250ms).  
- **Backend & APIs:** Node.js, Express.js, Flask, Python – building REST/GraphQL services, custom Elasticsearch queries, and AI integrations (OpenAI API, LangChain, Whisper).  
- **Data & Databases:** Elasticsearch (processing 25M+ records), MongoDB, PostgreSQL – with techniques like priority handlers to improve efficiency by 30%.  
- **DevOps & Tooling:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Docker, Jest, Storybook – automating builds, tests, and deployments for reliable workflows.  
- **AI & Emerging Tech:** LLMs (Langfuse, Agno, RAG pipelines), Solidity for blockchain (e.g., NFTs), AR systems.  
- **Auth & Cloud:** Keycloak, OAuth 2.0, NextAuth, AWS (Lambda, S3), Firebase, Stripe for secure and scalable features.  

# Open Source Component library
