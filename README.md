I'm a software engineer passionate about building scalable, efficient applications with a focus on AI integrations, performance optimization, and modern web technologies. I've developed tools that handle large-scale data (35M+ records), create AI-driven experiences, and automate workflows. Always exploring new tech and open to collaborations on innovative projects. Let's connect!

## 🛠️ Skills & Technologies
I specialize in tools and frameworks for creating robust, high-performance applications. Key areas include:

- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, React Native, TypeScript, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Highcharts, Mapbox – optimizing UIs for speed, even with data-intensive pages (e.g., reducing load times to 250ms).  
- **Backend & APIs:** Node.js, Express.js, Flask, Python – building REST/GraphQL services, custom Elasticsearch queries, and AI integrations (OpenAI API, LangChain, Whisper).  
- **Data & Databases:** Elasticsearch (processing 25M+ records), MongoDB, PostgreSQL – with techniques like priority handlers to improve efficiency by 30%.  
- **DevOps & Tooling:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Docker, Jest, Storybook – automating builds, tests, and deployments for reliable workflows.  
- **AI & Emerging Tech:** LLMs (Langfuse, Agno, RAG pipelines), Solidity for blockchain (e.g., NFTs), AR systems.  
- **Auth & Cloud:** Keycloak, OAuth 2.0, NextAuth, AWS (Lambda, S3), Firebase, Stripe for secure and scalable features.  

# Open Source Component library
- **[Agentic-UI](https://github.com/agenticui/agentic-ui)** (npm: [agenticui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agenticui))  
  **Tech:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS/NativeWind, Storybook, GitHub Actions.  
  A professional React library providing headless and styled components for AI workflows, such as chat interfaces and command palettes. Includes 25+ accessible, tree-shakable elements with themes, ARIA support, and automated CI/CD pipelines. Install with `npm i agenticui`.  


## 📜 Publications
- **AI-Based Augmented Reality Assistant**  
  *International Journal of Intelligent Systems and Applications in Engineering (IJISAE)*  
  [Read the Paper](https://ijisae.org/index.php/IJISAE/article/view/4617)  
  Research on integrating AR and AI to create responsive avatars that adapt to user interactions in real time. The prototype improved task efficiency by 25%.  

## 🔍 Current Focus & Interests
- Exploring agentic frameworks like Agno for building intelligent, autonomous AI agents.  
- Developing a design system for Agentic UI to create consistent, scalable components for AI-driven user interfaces.  
- Optimizing large-scale applications, such as dashboards handling 35M records with efficient request management.  
- Contributing to open-source tools for better developer experiences, including automated release processes.  
- Working on a React Native app with AI chatbot features and push notifications.
